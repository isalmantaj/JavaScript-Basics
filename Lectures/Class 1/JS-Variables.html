    <!-- Concept 1: Word vs Keyword

    Word:-
    Anything in programming or in JS programming which doesn't have any "meaning" is called WORD.
    Example;
    'man, chacha, mama, bhaiya, naam, waqt' are all Words.
    ---------
    Keyword:-
    Anything in programming or in JS programming which have any "meaning" is called WORD.
    Example;
    'let, var, for, else, if, while, do' are all Words.

    <!-- Staring Code of JavaScript -->
    <script> 
        // chacha = WORD
        // if = KEYWORD

        // Variable Declarations through let, var and const.
        // let name;
        // var name;
        // const name;

        // Variable Declaration + Initialization
        // let name = "Salman Taj"

        const name = "Salman Taj";
        var age = 23;
        let grade = "Bachelors";
        
        // Output of variables through
        document.write("The name you entered is = " + name + "<br>");
        document.write("The age you entered is = " + age + "<br>");
        document.write("The grade you entered is = " + grade + "<br>");

        console.log("The name you entered is = " + name);
        console.log("The age you entered is = " + age);
